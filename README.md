#Introduction

In my household we are primarily very energy conscious, and we always try to minimise our impact on the environment.

#Aim

This project is to attempt to create a realtime energy monitor with Arduino and a clamp with the aim of using with a raspberry-pi to display live energy data and possible identify items that have started using energy and track how much each devices uses.

The idea is that it will figure out/ or i train it as to the amount of current each device draw, and build a profile of that device. Then it can track how it uses current.
